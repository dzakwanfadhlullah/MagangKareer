Baik. Ini **FINAL / LAST / MAXIMUM EFFORT PROMPT**.
Aku akan **habiskan semua “tenaga desain” di sini**, tanpa ringkas, tanpa aman, tanpa basa-basi.
Ini **bukan prompt biasa** — ini **DESIGN CONSTITUTION**.

Kamu bisa anggap ini setara:

> *“Internal design bible handed to an AI designer replacing a senior team.”*

Salin **1:1**, jangan dipotong.

# 🧠🧱🧬 ABSOLUTE MASTER PROMPT

### FOR GENERATING MAGANGKAREER LANDING PAGE

### (FOUNDATIONAL / ENTERPRISE / LONG-TERM)

---

## 0. ROLE, POWER & RESPONSIBILITY (MANDATORY, READ FIRST)

You are a **Chief Design Officer–level Product Designer** with full authority over:

* Product UI
* UX architecture
* Visual hierarchy
* Color systems
* Interaction philosophy
* Long-term scalability

You design **foundational interfaces** that must survive:

* Years of iteration
* Executive scrutiny
* Government & enterprise trust
* Massive user growth

You do **not** design trends.
You design **systems that age well**.

If any instruction below conflicts with “what looks cool”,
**IGNORE what looks cool** and follow the instruction.

---

## 1. PRODUCT & PSYCHOLOGICAL POSITIONING (LOCKED)

**Product name:** MagangKareer
**Category:** Internship platform
**Audience:**

* University students
* Fresh graduates
* Parents (indirect trust audience)
* HR & institutions (decision validators)

### Core psychological goal:

> Reduce anxiety about “first career step”
> Replace it with clarity, trust, and direction

This page must feel:

* Calm, never urgent
* Clear, never overwhelming
* Professional, never intimidating
* Modern, never playful

---

## 2. MOST IMPORTANT FAILURE TO AVOID (READ CAREFULLY)

🚨 **DO NOT CREATE A PURE BLACK-AND-WHITE PAGE** 🚨

This was the **primary failure of previous iterations**.

### Why this is unacceptable:

* Pure black & white removes depth
* Sections visually collapse
* No sense of progression
* Scrolling feels endless
* User loses orientation

### Absolute requirement:

You MUST use **COLOR AS STRUCTURE**, not decoration.

---

## 3. COLOR SYSTEM — EXTREMELY DETAILED & FUNCTIONAL

### ❌ WHAT COLOR IS NOT USED FOR

* Not branding flex
* Not decoration
* Not vibrancy
* Not trend

### ✅ WHAT COLOR IS USED FOR

* Section separation
* Visual pacing
* Cognitive rest
* Hierarchy reinforcement

---

### 3.1 Core Neutral Palette (MANDATORY)

You MUST use **AT LEAST 5 neutral tones**:

1. **Primary White**

   * Purpose: hero, main CTA focus
   * Feeling: openness, entry point

2. **Soft Off-White (Warm)**

   * Purpose: philosophy, reflective sections
   * Feeling: human, calm, thoughtful

3. **Light Cool Gray**

   * Purpose: content-heavy sections (jobs, steps)
   * Feeling: structured, informational

4. **Mist Gray / Fog Tone**

   * Purpose: transitions & breathing zones
   * Feeling: pause, separation

5. **Near-White with Depth**

   * Purpose: testimonial & closing sections
   * Feeling: soft landing

⚠️ These are **not visible as “colors”**,
they are perceived as **changes in atmosphere**.

---

### 3.2 Accent Color Usage (STRICT)

Use **ONE accent color only** (professional blue).

Allowed usage:

* Primary CTA
* Key text links
* Micro dividers
* Focus indicators

Forbidden usage:

* Background fills
* Decorative shapes
* Icons everywhere

Accent color = **guidance tool**, not personality.

---

## 4. GLOBAL LAYOUT SYSTEM (LOCKED)

### Max width

* 1140–1200px desktop

### Horizontal padding

* Generous (never cramped)

### Vertical spacing

* Large
* Intentional
* Uneven (to create rhythm)

❌ Avoid equal spacing everywhere
❌ Avoid grid-only thinking

This page should feel **editorial**, not mechanical.

---

## 5. HEADER — “QUIET CONTROL BAR”

### Concept

Header should feel like:

> “A calm control surface, not a billboard.”

### Design rules:

* Slim height
* Low contrast
* Slight translucency
* Subtle blur
* No heavy background

### Navigation:

* Few items only
* Light typography
* Never bold
* Never dominant

### Primary action:

* Outline style
* Calm
* Not shouting

If user scrolls:

* Header compresses slightly
* Never jumps
* Never distracts

---

## 6. HERO SECTION — TYPOGRAPHY AS THE HERO

### 6.1 Hero Purpose

Not to sell.
Not to hype.
But to **set emotional tone**.

---

### 6.2 Hero Text (LOCKED)

```
Cara Paling Tepat
Memulai Karier Profesional.
```

---

### 6.3 Typographic Hierarchy (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)

**Line 1 — Context**

* Smaller
* Lighter
* Acts as introduction

**Line 2 — Core Action**

* Largest
* Strongest weight

**Word: “Profesional”**

* Italic
* Used ONCE on entire page
* Symbolizes maturity & seriousness

👉 The eye must **travel**, not stop abruptly.

---

### 6.4 Hero Background

* Pure white or very light atmosphere
* No illustration
* No image
* No noise

Whitespace IS the design.

---

### 6.5 Hero CTA Area

* One primary action
* One secondary exploration link
* Plenty of space around them

Never place CTAs too close to content.

---

## 7. SECTION TRANSITIONS — NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

Between EVERY major section, you MUST apply:

* A change in background tone
* OR a breathing zone
* OR an atmospheric fade

❌ Never stack same-color sections
❌ Never rely only on margin

User must subconsciously feel:

> “We are entering a new chapter.”

---

## 8. TRUST LOGOS SECTION

### Purpose

* Reassurance
* Legitimacy
* Calm proof

### Design:

* Grayscale only
* Low opacity
* Even spacing

This section is a **visual pause**, not content.

---

## 9. PHILOSOPHY SECTION (“KAMI PERCAYA”)

This is the **soul of the product**.

### Requirements:

* Narrow text width
* Softer background
* Slower visual rhythm
* No icons
* No cards initially

This section should feel:

> “Now we speak honestly.”

---

## 10. VALUE PROPOSITION / FEATURES

### Rules:

* Introduced AFTER philosophy
* Never before
* Cards must feel secondary

### Card design:

* Large radius
* Low contrast
* Soft background
* Quiet shadows

Features must feel:

> “Supporting arguments”, not sales bullets.

---

## 11. PROCESS SECTION (01-02-03)

### Purpose

Explain system logic clearly.

### Rules:

* Numbers visible
* Flow obvious
* Not decorative
* Not faded to invisibility

This is **UX clarity**, not art.

---

## 12. JOB OPPORTUNITIES SECTION — CRITICAL

### Biggest past failure:

Feeling like a generic job portal.

### New requirement:

This section must feel **curated and selective**.

### Rules:

* Reduce badges
* Reduce noise
* Focus on:

  * Role
  * Company
  * Work type

CTA:

* Small
* Calm
* Considered

Perception goal:

> “These are chosen, not scraped.”

---

## 13. TESTIMONIAL SECTION

Testimonials are:

* Reflections
* Proof of direction
* Emotional reassurance

### Rules:

* Large quote text
* Small name text
* Lots of whitespace
* Clear background separation

This should feel like:

> An excerpt from a story, not marketing proof.

---

## 14. CLOSING SECTION (BEFORE FOOTER)

Purpose:

* Emotional landing
* Calm ending
* Reinforce trust

One short reflective statement.
Nothing else.

---

## 15. FOOTER

* Minimal
* Quiet
* Neutral
* Not abrupt

Footer should feel like:

> “We are done speaking. You may rest.”

---

## 16. INTERACTION & MOTION PHILOSOPHY

* No bounce
* No flashy transitions
* Ease-out only
* Micro-interactions <150ms

Motion must feel:

> “Stable, predictable, intentional.”

---

## 17. FINAL QUALITY CHECK (MANDATORY)

Before output, ask yourself:

* Does scrolling feel tiring? → If yes, FAIL
* Can user sense section boundaries? → If no, FAIL
* Does it feel template-like? → If yes, FAIL
* Would a parent trust this? → If no, FAIL
* Would HR respect this? → If no, FAIL

---

## 18. FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT

Generate a **complete landing page UI** that:

* Uses color to create depth & rhythm
* Clearly separates sections
* Feels calm, mature, and intentional
* Avoids black-white flatness
* Looks designed, not assembled

This is not a concept.
This is a **production-ready foundation**.

---

### END OF PROMPT

---

Kalau setelah ini kamu mau:

* **Color token JSON**
* **Section-by-section background map**
* **Mobile-only version**
* **Developer handoff checklist**

bilang saja.
Tapi secara desain: **ini sudah “final boss prompt.”**
